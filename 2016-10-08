Dear Wholesale,

My name is Cedric, I am a private investigator from Belgium currently working on a case of stalking and cyberbullying.

One of my clients has experienced serious harassments in real life and on facebook, coming from a fake facebook profile.

It has come to a point where my client has found faeces smeared all over her door and later receiving the disturbing message you find enclosed in this email.

Using one of my own servers, hosting a php script to get the IP adres, I managed to retrieve the IP coming from one of your VPS (see subject).

As I'm sure you condemn this behavior as much as we do, I was hoping you could tell me which documents you require in order to provide our law enforcements services with the account and / or billing information used by the person performing the harrassment.

Looking forward to your response,

Cedric Sambre
